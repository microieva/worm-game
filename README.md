## WORM GAME




**A classical snake game version in Java, with 3 different obsticles (snacks) in effect.
Move the worm around using arrow keys and collect snacks. The longer the worm, the faster it moves.**


Snacks:

+ Apple: adds a piece;
+ Orange: removes a piece;
+ Mushroom: confuses the worm and makes it go backwards.
